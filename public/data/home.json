        "I'm a senior software engineer from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, specialising in full-stack development with a strong focus on backend implementation. My expertise spans FastAPI, Express.js, Angular and some other frameworks.",
        "I describe myself as a passionate developer who enjoys learning new technologies and continuously expanding my skill set. React, Next.js, pytest and basic level of Jenkins are a few of those that I have picked up along the way. I'm just as comfortable working solo as I am jamming with a team.",
        "Outside of code, I'm all about balance â€” work, life, sleep (when I can). That's why I'm a big fan of remote work: fewer commutes, more focus, better coffee."
